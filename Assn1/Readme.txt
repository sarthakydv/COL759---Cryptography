Language: Python 3
The working:
The code is  broken into 2 parts.
1. Functions: It contains all the functions used for the three parts in that order.
2. Execution: Uses Functions to execute the three steps in order.
How to run: python3 Execution.py
User Input:
1. The number of test cases
2. If the key found is correct:
    Go to next test case
   if incorrect:
     option to change the key length manually (can be taken from Kasaski Method results):
            Can be skipped
        key length changed or not, the code will now ask for the number of top hits for every character of the key
        Now, keeping entering the key manually to get the deciphered text until we get it right
    correct key found
  Program moves on to the next test case
